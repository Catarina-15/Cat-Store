     <h1>The Cat</h1>
    <h2>Change your life and adopt a cat.</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="intro">
      <p>"The Cat" is an association who protect and save cats from the streets. Our mission is to recover all the cats from the streets and help them to figure out a good place to live. We previde the vaccination and the castration from the cats.</p>
      <h2>Can I still adopt a cat if I have children?</h2>
      <p>This depends completely on the cat’s character. Some cats can integrate particularly well into families, while others will be nervous around children. Cats Protection will discuss with you which cats in care would be most likely to settle with children. There are great benefits for children growing up with cats – having a pet can teach them compassion as well as a sense of responsibility. Find out more about adopting a cat with young children in our guide.</p>
      <h2>How much is the adoption fee?</h2>
      <p> Our adoption fee varies from branch to branch and centre to centre. This is because some branches have to pay more for veterinary treatment than others, and some have higher costs when looking after cats.
        If you adopt from Cats Protection, your cat will have received a health check (and any medical treatment required), flea, roundworm and tapeworm treatment as well as at least one vaccination against cat flu and enteritis. They will have been neutered if relevant and microchipped. Your fee doesn’t cover all of these costs but will go towards paying them.</p>
